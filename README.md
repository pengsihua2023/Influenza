Influenza A viruses (haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes 1â€“16) circulate in the wild bird reservoir. Subtypes from this reservoir are able to cross into many different species, sometimes via intermediate hosts and sometimes requiring adaptive mutations (light blue arrows). Specific subtypes predominate in certain species (dark blue circles). Human-adapted influenza viruses of the H1, H2 and H3 subtypes have circulated in recent history. H1N1 and H3N2 viruses currently circulate whereas H2N2 viruses do not; the same three subtypes have also circulated in pigs. Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) of H5, H6, H7, H9 and H10 subtypes have infected humans following exposure to infected poultry. Viruses of these subtypes currently do not transmit between humans. HA subtypes H17 and H18 circulate only in bats169. Influenza B viruses circulate in humans, although infections in seals have been described170. Influenza C viruses circulate in humans and swine171. The recently discovered influenza D viruses are found to circulate in cattle, goats and pigs1. Despite some serological evidence of infection in humans, the zoonotic threat to humans remains unclear. Detection of influenza virus-like RNA in Wuhan Asiatic toads, Wenling hagfish and spiny eels has recently been described, although their genera remain to be defined172. Many species have been experimentally infected by influenza viruses, including ferrets, mice, guinea pigs, macaques and marmosets (reviewed in refs6,7).
