Influenza A viruses (haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes 1–16) circulate in the wild bird reservoir. Subtypes from this reservoir are able to cross into many different species, sometimes via intermediate hosts and sometimes requiring adaptive mutations (light blue arrows). Specific subtypes predominate in certain species (dark blue circles). Human-adapted influenza viruses of the H1, H2 and H3 subtypes have circulated in recent history. H1N1 and H3N2 viruses currently circulate whereas H2N2 viruses do not; the same three subtypes have also circulated in pigs. Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) of H5, H6, H7, H9 and H10 subtypes have infected humans following exposure to infected poultry. Viruses of these subtypes currently do not transmit between humans. HA subtypes H17 and H18 circulate only in bats169. Influenza B viruses circulate in humans, although infections in seals have been described170. Influenza C viruses circulate in humans and swine171. The recently discovered influenza D viruses are found to circulate in cattle, goats and pigs1. Despite some serological evidence of infection in humans, the zoonotic threat to humans remains unclear. Detection of influenza virus-like RNA in Wuhan Asiatic toads, Wenling hagfish and spiny eels has recently been described, although their genera remain to be defined172. Many species have been experimentally infected by influenza viruses, including ferrets, mice, guinea pigs, macaques and marmosets (reviewed in refs6,7).

In human cells, avian influenza viruses (AIVs) may encounter negative host factors (red) that human-adapted viruses overcome by viral gene adaptation (blue). AIVs may be unable to co-opt positive human host factors (gold) and human-adapted viruses may develop susceptibility to restriction factors (dark grey). a | Influenza A viruses are enveloped viruses containing eight single-stranded negative-sense RNA gene segments that each encode one or more proteins. b | Each RNA segment (red line) surrounds an oligomeric nucleoprotein (NP) structure (light grey), and the viral promoters are bound by the heterotrimeric polymerase complex containing polymerase basic proteins 1 (PB1) and 2 (PB2) and polymerase acidic protein (PA); the entire structure is known as the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. The eight segments encode ten essential viral proteins: PB1, PB2, PA and NP for RNA replication; non-structural protein 1 (NS1) to evade the host innate response; matrix protein M1 as the main structural matrix of the virus particle; nuclear export protein (NEP) for nuclear export of vRNPs; and haemagglutinin (HA), matrix protein M2 and neuraminidase (NA), which are embedded in the virion envelope for virus attachment, uncoating and onward spread, respectively. In addition, several accessory proteins such as protein PB1-F2, PB1-N40, PA-X, PB2-S1, matrix protein M42 and NS3 may be encoded by some but not all virus strains. c | Virus infection begins with cell attachment mediated by binding of HA to sialic acid (SA) receptors on the cell surface (step 1). Entry of the virion is by endocytosis, and the decrease in pH within the endosome triggers an irreversible conformational change in HA that exposes the hydrophobic fusion peptide and stimulates the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane154. At the same time, the passage of protons and potassium ions through the small ion channel M2 acidifies the virion interior and mediates dissociation of M1 from vRNPs, releasing the vRNPs into the cell cytoplasm175,176. Interferon-regulated resistance GTP-binding protein MxA and retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I) restrict AIV vRNPs in the cytoplasm. Mutations in human-adapted NP evade MxA binding. Human-adapted vRNPs with PB2 627K are less vulnerable to RIG-I detection. vRNPs are imported into the nucleus (step 2). Humanizing mutations in PB2 enable importin-α7 (IMPα7; also known as KPNA6) use and enhance vRNP nuclear import. Primary transcription occurs in cis and in conjunction with the cellular RNA polymerase II (step 3)177. Viral mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm for translation by the cellular machinery (step 4). Human-adapted NP is susceptible to degradation by tripartite motif-containing protein 22 (TRIM22). AIV PA is susceptible to inhibition by HS1-associating protein X1 (HAX1), but this can be counteracted by protein PB1-F2. The newly synthesized polymerase and NP proteins are imported into the nucleus to carry out replication and further (secondary) transcription (step 5). Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member A (ANP32A) or B (ANP32B) and small viral RNAs (svRNAs) promote viral RNA (vRNA) production from complementary RNA (cRNA) (yellow line). AIV polymerase cannot utilize human ANP32A or ANP32B and must gain human-adapting mutations such as PB2 627K. NEP can also overcome the AIV polymerase restriction. DEAD box protein 17 (DDX17) restricts AIV polymerase PB2 627E and promotes activity of human-adapted polymerase containing PB2 627K. Newly formed vRNPs are exported to the cytoplasm by M1 and the NEP178 (step 6). vRNPs and other viral products are detected by multiple cell sensors. Mitochondrial Tu elongation factor (TUFM) binds to AIV PB2 containing 627E, increasing autophagy and decreasing virus production. Human-adapted PB2 and protein PB1-F2 localize to mitochondria and prevent detection by mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS). NS1 binds to RIG-I to prevent activation. vRNPs transported to the cell surface for packaging are assembled with the structural proteins (HA, NA, M1 and M2) (step 7). Progeny virions are formed by budding from host cell plasma membrane, and release is mediated by scission of the membrane by M2 (step 8). Onward spread is facilitated by the removal of SA from the cell surface, from viral particles and from mucus by NA179. Short-stalk avian NAs are unable to escape human respiratory tract mucus; human-adapted viruses with long-stalk NAs can overcome this restriction.
